### Installation
No additional libraries beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python are necessary. The code should 
run with no issues using Python version 3.8

### Motivation
Real estate information of a particular region or location is not 
easy to come by. In this notebook we investigate an Austrian real estate data set which has been mined
extracted over the course of one week from a large online portal. The data has already been 
pre-processed and can be regional investigated.
